This may include failing to recognize derogatory comments targeted at specific groups, as it may not have been trained on sufficient examples reflecting such prejudice. By enhancing the model's training data with a diverse range of contexts, we can potentially strengthen its ability to identify offensive language and reduce misclassifications, such as those involving immigration-related comments."

This can happen when the model fails to understand the potential condemning tone or the specific cultural implications of certain religious statements, treating them as mere statements of belief or opinion. For instance, the model might miss the nuanced critique implied in phrases like \"fake ass Christian,\" which could be offensive to some.
